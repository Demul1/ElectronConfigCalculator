# ElectronConfigCalculator

## About
This is a simple Javascript program that allows you practice and improve at electron configuration. The program randomly chooses from all 118 elements of the periodic table, and prompts the user to find the shorthand electron configuration for that element. It also tells the user whether they answered it correctly or incorrectly, as well as allows them to continue playing. This was simply for a school project, but I decided to put it here anyway.
