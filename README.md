# ElectronConfigCalculator

## About
This is a simple Javascript program that allows you practice and better learn electron configuration. It randomly chooses from all 118 elements of the periodic table, and prompts the user to enter the shorthand electron configuration for that element. The program will inform the user if they answered the question correctly, or incorrectly, and give them the option to continue practicing.
